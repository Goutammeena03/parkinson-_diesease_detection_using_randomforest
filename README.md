# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Voice Data and Random Forest

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of Parkinson's disease using voice data and a machine learning model based on the Random Forest algorithm. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control, and it has been observed that individuals with Parkinson's often exhibit distinct vocal characteristics.

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify voice recordings as either indicative of Parkinson's disease or healthy controls.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises voice recordings from individuals with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the dataset for research purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc. (Specify dependencies in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Goutammeena03/parkinson-_diesease_detection_using_randomforest.git
   cd parkinsons-voice-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Ensure that your voice data is organized and labeled appropriately. Update the dataset path and other relevant configurations in the code.

2. **Model Training:**

   Train the Random Forest model using the provided script:

   ```bash
   python .py
   ```

   This script will preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance.
## GUI using stream lit 
   ```bash
   streamlit app.py run
   ```

## Results

Document the performance metrics and any relevant findings from the model evaluation. Include charts or graphs if applicable.
